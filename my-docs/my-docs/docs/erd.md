# Entity-Relationship Diagram

This ERD captures the core data model from the system requirements, including users, Iddirs, payments, resources, and supporting entities like rules and grievances.

## Overview
Entities support modules like member management (profiles/histories), payments (transactions/receipts), and inventory (resources/rentals). Relationships: One Iddir has many Members; One Member has many Contributions/Resources Borrowed.
